    """
    A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
    1) Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all
    keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.
    2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all
    keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.
    Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap, where the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in binary heap.
    The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Heap.
    Below is the implementation of Min Heap.
    Although python provides a library heapq, but it only supports Min Heap by default and Max Heap requires some work
    around.
